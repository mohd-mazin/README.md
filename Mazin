# AI Projects by Mazin

Welcome! This repository contains my personal AI-related Python projects, built to explore real-world applications of artificial intelligence and data science.

## 🔍 Project 1: Chatbot using Python
- A simple AI-based chatbot built with Python.
- Uses pattern matching and response generation based on user input.
- Demonstrates basic concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 📊 Project 2: Student Score Analyzer
- A Python program that takes student marks as input and generates an analysis report.
- Shows averages, high/low performance, and visual trends.
- Useful for educators and students to track academic performance.

## 📌 Future Goals
As an aspiring AI student, I plan to expand this repository with:
- Machine Learning model training (e.g., sklearn, TensorFlow)
- Computer Vision projects
- AI applications in healthcare and education

## 💡 Why AI?
My deep interest in artificial intelligence comes from its potential to solve real-world problems — especially in education, healthcare, and automation. I aim to contribute to responsible, impactful AI development.
